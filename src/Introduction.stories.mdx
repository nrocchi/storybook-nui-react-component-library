# NUI React Component Library

> ⚠️ **NUI React Component Library is currently in BETA**.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nui-test.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nui-test)
[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](#)

A custom React component library using [MUI](https://mui.com/), [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com/), [Date FNS](https://date-fns.org/), [I18next](https://www.i18next.com/), [React-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/), [React Dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/), [Material Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

My goal is to deliver React UI components using third-party libraries for React developers and a design system to create a consistent UI/UX for application users.

Components can be modified via theme or styles the same as [MUI](https://mui.com/) components.

## Get started

I want to create a component library and its documentation that results in :

- Understanding of how each component works and how you can use it to create a great user experience.
- Short development times and consistent code quality.
- A beautiful, visually consistent user experience.
- Transparency about how it works and what you can do.

### Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.

Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

`npm install nui`

`yarn add nui`

### Documentation
Browse the [catalog of the components](#) and see what you can do :

- **Explore NUI components** :
  Click on any of the component in the sidebar to see how they look, and how to configure them. Each component pages contains documentation of its properties, as well as code examples for how to use it.
- **Try them out** :
  - Experiment with different properties, by clicking **Canvas** at the top of each component page.
  - Change the properties under **Controls** in the bottom panel.
- **Use them** :
  Once you've found the right component for your use case, click the **JSX** tab to see the code implementation, or look at examples under **Docs**.

For more details, refer to the [package source](#).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run :

`npm run build` : Build the library

`npm run doc` : Launch the documentation in local mode, open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view the documentation in the browser.

`npm run doc:build` : Build the static html documentation

`npm run format:check` : Check the code format

`npm run format:write` : Format the code

`npm run lint:check` : Check the linter

`npm run lint:fix` : Fix lint errors

`npm run test` : Launch the test runner
